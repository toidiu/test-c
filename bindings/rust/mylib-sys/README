`cargo build` to generate the bindings.

Pre-requisite:
- build the C project

The output of this crate is `ffi.rs` and `manual_ffi.rs`. The `ffi.rs` is generate by bindgen.

TODO:
We currently need to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.. which is cumbersome.

Since the `target` dir is search by default, we can put the dylib there.
- copy the source here and compile it here
- copy dylib there (ehh)
